# ShapeOfInheritance
 The project aims to create a Shape class with a display method and a Shape Printer class that works with the base class. Five shape classes (e.g., Circle, Quad) will inherit from Shape. The Shape Printer will accept a shape object and print its name, following OOP principles (interfaces, abstract classes, access modifiers).
